Analyzing trends in visitor attendance to public programs.

## quant_sandbox-FoodFight

This notebook lets me play around with quantitative analysis of Altru output. Currently set up to take two files, one with program data and another with attendee data (from the Altru analysis queries Program Query: Food Fight and Registrant Query: Food Fight, respectively), and customized for the Food Fight program series.
